00:25.000 --> 00:31.000
Today, we're going to pick a winner. 
By the end of this, I believe that we'll both agree.

2
00:32.000 --> 00:37.000
The long-lived debate: the book vs the movie. 
  
3
00:37.000 --> 00:40.000
Spoiler: the book wins.
  
4
00:41.000 --> 00:49.500
Think of some books you've come to know and love over the years. 
For some, the titles are popping into your head. 
  
5
00:49.500 --> 00:54.500
For others, you might still be stuck on the book you got 
assigned in English class.
  
6
00:54.500 --> 01:05.500
Now, think of some of the movies you've come to know and love. 
The Color Purple, Matilda, Ready Player One, The Godfather,

7
01:05.500 --> 01:11.000
Shawshank Redmeption, Wonder, Dune. 
Bear with me.

8
01:11.000 --> 01:22.500
The Devil Wears Prada, Crazy Rich Asians, The Social Network, 
The Silence of the Lambs, Killers of the Flower Moon.

9
01:22.500 --> 01:27.500
Did I cover them all? It's a variety, for sure, 
but they all share one thing.

10
01:27.500 --> 01:35.500
All of these were based on books. So, add them to your list.

10
01:36.500 --> 01:44.500
Next time you feel like you want some adventure or some action or 
some romance or some mystery...
  
11
01:44.500 --> 01:50.500
...don't go scrolling through Netflix. 
Don't drive all the way to the cinema. 
  
12
01:50.500 --> 01:53.500
Pick up a book. 
I promise you won't be disappointed!
